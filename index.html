           <h2 class="center">About Me</h2>

           <p class="center">I was born on July 2, 1995. Since that day, I've done everything in my power to learn as much as I possibly can in subjects that interest me. At the age of 15, I could play <em>13 instruments</em> fluently, almost like music was just second nature to me. Then I learned to produce music and I've helped several artists publish over 20 songs so far.
           </p>

           <p class="center">After that, I discovered a new-found interest in <em>3D animating</em>. I haven't published any animations yet but I have spent months playing around with the programs so I could fully understand everything that went into making animations. In the program, there is an add-on called <em>MustardUI</em>, which allows you to do certain things in the program without writing any new code. I wanted to know how it worked so bad. So I opened the <strong>.py</strong> to see for myself. </p>

           <p class="center">Which brings us to today! I understood absolutely nothing about the coding that went into the add-on. So I started browsing the internet to find out what was happening. That's where I discovered <em>Thinkful</em>. I'm to grow my knowledge in coding so that I can be a <em>web developer</em> and <em>software engineer</em> in the future.</p>
